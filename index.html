    <h2>Features of Note</h2>
     <p id="tribute-info">Pandora is an Earth-like habitable extrasolar moon from the Alpha Centauri System, the closest star system to human's own Solar System. It is the fifth moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which orbits Alpha Centauri A. The names of both the moon and its mother planet are coined by humans in reference to figures in Greek mythology.</p>
     
     <ul id="list">
      <li>Pandora's atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (>18%), xenon (>5.5%), methane, and hydrogen sulfide (>1%)</li>    
     <li>The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the Pandoran atmosphere makes it extremely poisonous to humans.</li> 
       <li>The Pandoran surface features jungles, mountains, volcanoes, plains (savanna), and oceans.</li>
       <li>There is a giant neural ntework that covers Pandora, linking all flora and fauna together.</li>
       <li>The Hallelujah Mountains (floating land masses) are largely considered to be the most fmaous landmark of Pandora.</li>
     </ul>
       
       <h2>The Na'Vi</h2>
       <p id="navi-info">The Na'vi (English: The People) are a race of sentient extraterrestrial humanoids who inhabit the lush jungle moon of Pandora. Humans are known to refer to them as "blues", "savages", "the locals", "hostiles", or "the natives". When the humans arrived, they began to search Pandora for valuable minerals. The Na'vi were appalled and angered by the destruction of their jungle home for roads, human bases and strip mines. They saw no need for technology and felt that the damage done by humans in the pursuit of underground minerals was nothing more than senseless destruction that violated the basic tenets of their religion. Before the war that ensued, Dr Grace Augustine realised the significance (both spiritually and scientifically) of Pandora and it's people. This was a cause she eventually gave her life to protect. </p>
